# Publishing `@asteby/metacore-*` packages

End-to-end guide for releasing packages from this monorepo and propagating updates to consumer apps. The pipeline is fully automated with [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) + a single GitHub Actions workflow.

## TL;DR

1. Change code in `packages/*`.
2. Run `pnpm changeset` and pick the bump (patch / minor / major) per affected package.
3. Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` alongside your code in a PR.
4. When your PR merges to `main`, the **Release npm packages** workflow opens (or updates) a `chore(release): version packages` PR.
5. Merging that "Version Packages" PR bumps versions, regenerates changelogs, and triggers `changeset publish` to npm under the `@asteby` scope.
6. Renovate bots in consumer apps (Ops, Link, internal panels) pick up the new versions and open PRs. Patch / minor bumps auto-merge; majors await human review.

## Prerequisites

- **`NPM_TOKEN` repo secret** in `asteby/metacore-sdk` — a [Granular Access Token](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-access-tokens) with publish permission on the `@asteby` scope and the **"Bypass 2FA"** option enabled. Generate it under <https://www.npmjs.com/settings/asteby/tokens>.
- **Repo permissions:** the workflow declares `contents: write`, `pull-requests: write`, and `id-token: write`. Make sure "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" is enabled in repo Settings → Actions → General.
- **pnpm 10+** locally (matches CI). The root `packageManager` field is authoritative.
- **Node.js 20+** locally.

## The release workflow

File: [`.github/workflows/release-npm.yml`](../.github/workflows/release-npm.yml).

It runs on every push to `main`:

- If the push **contains** `.changeset/*.md` files not yet versioned, [`changesets/action@v1`](https://github.com/changesets/action) opens or updates a single PR titled `chore(release): version packages` whose diff bumps `package.json` versions and moves the changesets into `CHANGELOG.md`.
- If the push **is** that PR being merged (so no changesets are left), the action runs `pnpm exec changeset publish`, which executes `turbo run build --filter=./packages/*` followed by `changeset publish`, pushing any packages whose versions bumped to npm.

The action reads [`.changeset/config.json`](../.changeset/config.json) for scope, access (`public`), linked packages, and base branch.

## Authoring a changeset

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

Pick:

- **Which packages changed.** Space to toggle, enter to confirm.
- **Bump level.**
  - `patch` — bug fix, docs, internal refactor with no API change.
  - `minor` — new backwards-compatible feature.
  - `major` — breaking change. Triggers consumer-side human review via Renovate.
- **Summary.** Goes straight into the CHANGELOG. Write it for humans, not for git history. Imperative voice ("add", "fix", "remove"), one line, ideally under 80 chars.

Commit the generated `.changeset/*.md` in the same PR as your code. Reviewers eyeball both the change and the bump.

## Pre-releases (next / beta / rc)

Use the `pre` mode when you want to ship from `main` without going stable:

```bash
pnpm changeset pre enter next
pnpm changeset        # author changeset as usual
# ...merge PRs to main, each publishes as e.g. 0.3.0-next.0, 0.3.0-next.1
pnpm changeset pre exit
```

While in pre mode the release workflow publishes with the `next` dist-tag, so `pnpm add @asteby/metacore-ui@next` opts in. Exit pre mode before the stable release PR.

For an isolated channel (e.g., `beta`), use `pnpm changeset pre enter beta`.

## Linked and ignored packages

`.changeset/config.json` configures two important constraints:

- `linked: [["@asteby/metacore-ui", "@asteby/metacore-theme"]]` — UI and theme **must** version together. They share a design contract; bumping one alone breaks consumers.
- `ignore: ["@asteby/metacore-starter-core", "create-metacore-app"]` — these packages are private / internal and excluded from the publish flow. Their changesets are still generated but never trigger npm publishes.

Do not edit these without understanding the downstream effect on consumers.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Version Packages" PR never opens.** No unversioned `.changeset/*.md` files on `main`. Run `pnpm changeset` and push.
- **Publish step fails with 401 / 403.** `NPM_TOKEN` missing, expired, or lacks publish rights on `@asteby`. Regenerate as a Granular Access Token with "Bypass 2FA" enabled and update the repo secret.
- **Publish succeeds for some packages but skips others.** Check the package's `"private": true` flag and that `.changeset/config.json` `ignore` array doesn't list it.
- **Linked packages drifted.** `@asteby/metacore-ui` and `@asteby/metacore-theme` must bump together. The `linked` array enforces this — don't remove it without understanding the downstream effect on consumers.
- **`pnpm install` fails in CI with `ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_BROKEN`.** The lockfile is regenerated via `--frozen-lockfile=false`. If it persists, delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` locally, reinstall, commit.
- **Version Packages PR has merge conflicts with `pnpm-lock.yaml`.** Close it. The next push to `main` regenerates a clean one.
- **Consumer app didn't get a Renovate PR.** Confirm the consumer's `renovate.json` matches [`renovate-consumer-template.json`](./renovate-consumer-template.json) and that Renovate is installed on the consumer repo (`github.com/apps/renovate`).
